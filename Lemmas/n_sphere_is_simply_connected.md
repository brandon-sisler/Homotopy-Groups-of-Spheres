
**Theorem:** Let $\mathbb{S}^n, n \geq 2$ be the $n$-sphere with the standard topology inherited from $\mathbb{R}^n.$ Then $\mathbb{S}^n$ is simply connected.

**proof:**
Let $p, q \in \mathbb{S}^n$ be two anitpodal points. Then $U = \mathbb{S}^n/\{p\}, V = \mathbb{S}^n/\{q\}$ must be open sets in $\mathbb{S}^n,$ since points are closed in a Hausdorf space. They are also isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n,$ and thus simply connected (since they are contractible). It is clear that the intersection of these spaces is non-empty and path-connected. Thus, by the Seifert-van Kampen theorem we can conclude that $\mathbb{S}^n$ is simply connected.
